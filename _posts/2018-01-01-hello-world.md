I've been thinking of starting a blog for a very long time, and finally here it is. Currently, I am committing myself on doing one blog post per month though it'd be really great if I could manage time for writing more often. Other than that, I also plan on sharing my projects here on this site. Let's see how this goes.

It should be noted that I chose to host this website on Github Pages and it is powered by the Jekyll templating engine. The reasons being that Github provides truly free and extremely reliable, their own CDN-powered hosting and learning Jekyll was fun too. I would recommend everyone to check this option out when developing personal websites or small blogs.
